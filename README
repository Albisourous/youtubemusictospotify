Transfer Liked Youtube Music Songs to Spotify

This is a set of scripts that can be used to convert youtube music files to spotify music.

Why is this needed?

I made this tool because I wanted to convert my liked music on youtube to spotify.
The exsisting tools did not work for this use case since this require a specific playlist url.
I wanted to convert my liked music on youtube, which a genericURL "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=LM",
to spotify by adding all of these songs to my likes not a specific playlist.
This would not work in the exsisting tools, so I made my own workaround.


There are a few steps to this process.

1. Open liked music on Youtube Music "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=LM"
2. Scroll down to bottom of page on liked playlist, if you do not do this it will only give you the songs that are
present on the page.
3. Open inspect element on Youtube Music page and swap over to the console
4. Run the script in extractFromYTMusic.js, you should get a txt file called
playlist_output.txt
5. Run `pip install spotipy --upgrade` to install spotipy tool https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/#installation
6.
